## What is SEO?

SEO, or **Search Engine Optimization**, is a set of practices designed to improve the appearance and positioning of web pages in organic search results.

### Benefits of SEO:

- **Increased Website Traffic:** SEO brings organic traffic, which is highly targeted and results in higher conversions.

## Key Components of SEO

SEO is typically divided into three main components, each of which plays a critical role in your website's overall success in search engine rankings.

### 1. On-Page SEO

On-page SEO involves optimizing individual web pages to rank higher and earn more relevant traffic in search engines. It includes optimizing content, HTML tags (title, meta, and header), and images.

#### Best Practices for On-Page SEO:

- **Title Tags:** Ensure your title tags are descriptive, include your primary keyword, and are 50-60 characters long.
- **Meta Descriptions:** Keep meta descriptions concise, around 155-160 characters, and include your target keyword.
- **Header Tags (H1, H2, H3):** Use structured headings to make content easy to read for both users and search engines.
- **Keyword Optimization:** Use targeted keywords naturally throughout your content without keyword stuffing.

#### Key Off-Page SEO Strategies:

- **Backlink Building:** Secure links from reputable, high-authority websites.
- **Social Signals:** Engage with users on social media platforms, as search engines view social engagement as a positive ranking signal.
